# CodeQuizChallenge

This program is designed to text your knowledge of javascript. It is a timed quiz that will subtract time when
the wrong answer is selected. It will store the scores on local storage and ask the user to input their initials, so you compare the scores and will sort them based on the highest score.






This program includes code from class assignments, xpert learning assistant and stack overflow.
